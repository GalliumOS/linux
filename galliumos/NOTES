## galliumos/NOTES

This directory borrows some debian organizational conventions.

The upstream kernel git config ignores "debian", "patches", and "series",
so we rename them to "galliumos", "diffs", and "sequence".

If we edited .gitignore instead, we'd risk incomplete commits if a new
upstream version was untarred on top and restored the original ignore
behaviour. So this is awkward, but safe.
